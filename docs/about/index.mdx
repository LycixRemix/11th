### Welcome! Here is 阿琳LycixRemix 👏

I've always thought that procrastination is a person's worst enemy. Whenever I make up my mind to do something, this damn bad habit will always appear to prevent me from taking action. As they say, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step". If I can't start, I can't realise what I want to do, so I think I need to get rid of this damn bad habit (damn it, think about it, do it first).

Coding and writing something amusing or useful may be a nice way to spend time ^^, and I hope I can do more in the next few years.
